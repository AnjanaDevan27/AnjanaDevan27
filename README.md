# Hi, I'm Anjana Deivasigamani 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate and driven Data Science graduate student at Northeastern University with a strong foundation in software engineering and hands-on experience in building data-driven solutions. My interests lie at the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, and business intelligence.

I've transitioned into data-centric roles where I design analytical systems, build cloud-native data pipelines, and derive insights using statistical and machine learning techniques.
